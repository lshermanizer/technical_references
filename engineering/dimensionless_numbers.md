## Reynolds number
```
Re=u*D/mu
u, [m/s], freestream velocity
D, [m], reference length
mu, [m^2/s], kinetic viscosity
```

## Strouhal number
```
S=(D/u)/(1/fs), or in terms of vortex shedding frequency fs=S*u/D
u, [m/s], freestream velocity approaching the cylinder
D, [m], cylinder diameter
fs, [Hz], predominant frequency of vortex shedding
```
