## stress stiffening

`K_tot = K + S`, where `K` = original stiffness matrix, `S` = stress stiffening matrix.

S can be calculated by a nonlinear static structural analysis for which an iterative process is required.

## Spring softening

`K_tot = K + S + S'`, where `S'` is the sping softening stiffness matrix. When a structure spins and elongates, the stiffness in the radial direction will drop.

## linear analysis

A linear analysis is w.r.t. a certain nonlinear state.

## Nonlinear stiffness

Stiffness may be nonlinear due to e.g. large deformation effect.
